This setup is to create a test environment for developing ganeti.
It by itself neither requires nor makes configuration changes in
the host machine.

This setup requires virtualbox and vagrant.

Some precautions. Run create_vms to create the VMs. DO NOT use
vagrant up. Similarly, Run destroy_vms to destroy the VMs.
Run start_vms to start the VMs after halting. vagrant halt can
be used to stop the VMs as usual.
