This setup is to create a test environment for developing ganeti.
It by itself neither requires nor makes configuration changes in
the host machine.

Some precautions. Run create_vms to create the VMs. DO NOT use
vagrant up. Similarly, Run destroy_vms to destroy the VMs.
vagrant up and vagrant halt can be used to start and stop the VMs
otherwise.
